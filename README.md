## TagJump

Jumping with tags is a pain if you are used to tabs. TagJump open a new tab when you jump (when the file is already open, it will jump to the opened tab, i.e. behaves like `tab drop`). It also automatically close the tab when you jump back with `<C-t>`. This prevents you from creating duplicate tabs when you jump to the same file multiple times.
